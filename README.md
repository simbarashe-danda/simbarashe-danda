# Hi, I'm Simbarashe 👋

## Software Engineering Student | Performance Engineering Focus

I'm on a 4‑year journey to become a high‑performance systems engineer, focusing on low‑level optimization and rigorous CS fundamentals. I study systems, algorithms, and computer architecture so I can write and tune software that makes the hardware sing.
